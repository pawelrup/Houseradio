## Requirements

Xcode 11, Swift 5.1

## Installation

To run the example project, first you need to clone [RxAnimated](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxAnimated) and convert it to Swift 5.1 and Swift Package. Then clone this project repo and add previously cloned and translated [RxAnimated](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxAnimated) to the project. You will also need to create your own `.xcconfig` file and place it in `/Config` directory of the project. In case of problems take look at [this](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/let-s-setup-your-ios-environments) tutorial.
